The first days in a new company are important. Getting productive quickly, meeting colleagues and breathing in the company culture. A mentor and the right tooling will help.

## What is it?

Remote Onboarding is the process of integrating new employees who are not onsite into an
organization.

## Why use it?

New employees should gain the knowledge and skills they need to become efficient members of an
organisation, even if they were not able to be onsite. The social component is also important for a
successful integration of new employees.

## How to do it?

* First, contact the new employee and inform him/her/it that the start will be online
* Send a welcome package to his/her/it home, containing the hardware, a description of the
first steps and all access keys. Send also contact details for help. Clarify the expectations, so
that the new colleague does not feel the pressure to have to set up everything
independently before the first day
* Before the first day, the mentor should prepare the tasks and a schedule for the first week.
and invite the new employee to upcoming appointments
* Organize a welcome-video call with all the new employees for the first day. It allows them
to meet other new employees and have their first “allies”
* On the first day give a warm welcome to all the new people joining the video meeting.
After the short welcome meeting, the new employees will meet their project team. There
they will get all the information they need to start work, for example, where they can get
information or what else is good to know.
* Don`t forget the social integration. Organize non-work meetings for example virtual lunch
meetings. The mentor should encourage the new employee to join communities. We
suggest the slack app donut. This feature facilitates virtual coffee meetups with different
people every week.
* Schedule appointments with the other districts for example with the HR or IT-department.
The HR could give some short information about the processes
* Make also sure the new person has a meeting with his/her/it manager
* Introduce the new employee to the organisation in virtual meetings
* Organize a feedback meeting after a few weeks.
