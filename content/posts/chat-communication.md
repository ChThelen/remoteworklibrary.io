Instant messaging tools simplify the communication in remote work settings if you stick to a few basic rules.

<!--more-->

## What is it?

Via a chat tool a team can communicate with eachother 1:1 or in (larger) groups. This comes in handy especially if the team works distributed.
 
## Why use it?

In a chat a distributed team can communicate quick and easy - almost as if they would sit next to each other. This way a chat tool also helps to socialize and to maintain the corporate culture in remote settings.

## How to do it?

Just as in a regular conversation, it is important to note that certain rules of communication also apply in chat communication:

* always be aware of the range and the target group of the message
* read the message carefully again before sending and ask yourself how your counterpart might perceive it and whether you have expressed yourself clearly. If there are formulations that are misunderstandable, correct them.
* pay attention to give sufficient context so that the message is understandable
* note the standard rules of communcation (Hello, Hi, Please, Thank You; no insults)
* communicate appreciative and don't critisise without having a constructive solution/alternative at hand
* when a situation gets dicey, seek 1:1 conversation over phone or video call
* keep the messages as short and concise as possible. For larger texts make use of the formatting functions to increase readability or write an e-mail.
* try to reduce notifications, e.g. by bundling the request/message
* use status options to show your availability
* be aware that messages are not always answered immediately
