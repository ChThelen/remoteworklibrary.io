Onsite interviews are ideal for both parties to get to know each other from a professional and cultural perspective. This post describes why it also works in a remote setting.

## What is it?

It is a process for hiring remotely.

## Why use it?

Remote recruiting enables hiring new employees anywhere.

## How to do it?

### Before the interview:

* Decide for a video call tool which is easy to handle for all people and respects Data
Protection Law
* Reflect if you need additional tools. For example, our candidates must solve a technical
exercise, therefore we need additional tools
* Inform the candidates about your remote recruiting process and explain them why you are
recruiting remotely
* Invite the candidate to a video call and ask if a remote interview is fine. If the candidate
prefers an onsite meeting, then approve this decision and organize a meeting onsite or
explain him why you are not able to meet onsite.
* Send the login codes and inform about the procedure. Don`t forget to send contact details
(including a telephone number) in case the candidate needs to get in touch with you, i.e. if
something goes wrong
* Share your remote meeting guidelines (see Remote Meeting Guideline) and inform the
candidate about the dress code
* Make sure you have enough time for the meeting
* If you are more than one interviewer, then prepare a clear structure of the meeting and set
a moderator

### During the interview:

* Start the interview with a warm welcome, say something nice and make sure the
candidates can hear you.
* Give a short introduction to the use of the video call tool
* Explain the agenda und keep the time in mind. If the interview lasts longer than 2 hours,
don`t forget to make a break.
* Remember yourself to speak into the camera and to smile. The candidates can only see
your face, so a smile is a very important sign for the candidate to take away his
nervousness
* The ongoing interview is equivalent to interviews onsite. Use a combination of technical
and cultural questions. We have noticed that during a virtual interview it is more difficult
to get a feeling for the person. Therefore, we focus more on questions regarding the
cultural fit
* The time between the question and the answer seems to be longer than in face-to-face
meetings. Allow the candidate this extra time and do not stress him/her/it
* You can use telepresence hardware to give the candidate a view of the organisation rooms
(see session Telepresence)
* For more tips see also the session Video Conferencing
