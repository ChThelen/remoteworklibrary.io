Sometimes it is important to get instant feedback from colleagues during a meeting or a workshop or in the middle of the working day. There are excellent tools to get input quickly and easily.

## What is it and why use it?

"A smile often says more than a thousand words". A simple and honest smile is an instant feedback, for example on a decision made in a meeting. What might be simple in a meeting room quickly becomes a challenge in a video call or in an asynchronous communication via e-mail or messenger. In this case you always have to explicitly ask for feedback, e.g. during a meeting to make the right decision or to have an agreement on the next steps.

## How to do it?

### Thumbs up

In small meetings it is easy to explicitly add a short feedback question with pre-defined answers: How do you feel about the decision? Thumbs up, thumbs down or ok? We call these polls "Flash Light Polls" and they are comparable to a mix of *Traffic Light Polls* and *Muddiest Point* ([CATs]({{< relref "#tools" >}})). After giving their answer, participants who have shown their thumbs down can briefly explain their disagreement in one sentence and propose a compromise solution. The goal of this exercise is to enable the moderator to quickly measure the confidence of all participants on a certain topic.

During a remote meeting, such a survey can be technically implemented very quickly:

* In a video conference, each participant holds his/her thumb or a [traffic light]({{< relref "#tools" >}}) card into the camera.
* Some video conferencing tools offer features for non-verbal instant feedback. For example [Zoom]({{< relref "#tools" >}})

### Polls

If you don't like analog polls so much, there are also many digital tools for instant feedback polls.

#### Video Conferencing Polls

Good video conferencing tools have poll features integrated in their clients. As a moderator you can create polls before the meeting and export the results afterwards.

The first video shows how you can create surveys with zoom and use them in a meeting:

The second video shows the same for Webex:

#### Messenger Polls

Messenger services can also be easily used for instant feedback polls during a meeting. Depending on the messenger, polls are either already included in the product or can be added as an extension. A very popular extension for Slack and Microsoft teams is [Polly]({{< relref "#tools" >}}).

The fastest way to set up an instant feedback poll with Polly in Slack are yes-no questions. These can be created with a *slash command* in a channel.

/yesno Do we have to discuss a second example?

For simple surveys you do not necessarily need an extension. You can also simply write a post and the participants answer with emojis.

#### Real-time presentation feedback

If you use Microsoft Powerpoint, Apple Keynote or Google Slides in a meeting, you can integrate real-time feedback tools for interactive questions directly into the presentation. The participants then vote via a web or smartphone app and the results are directly visible in the presentation. Examples of these types of tools are [Mentimeter and Poll Everywhere]({{< relref "#tools" >}}). The drawback of these solutions is that the surveys must be prepared in advance and cannot be integrated on the fly during a meeting.
