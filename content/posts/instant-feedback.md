Sometimes it is important to get feedback from colleagues during a meeting, workshop or in the middle of the working day. There are excellent tools for getting input quickly and easily.

## What is it and why use it?

"A smile often says more than a thousand words". A simple honest smile is an instant feedback, for example on a decision made in a meeting. What might be simple in a meeting room quickly becomes a challenge in a video call or in an asynchronous communication via email or messenger. In this case you always have to explicitly aks for feedback, often during a meeting to make the right decisions to have an agreement for the next steps.

## How to do it?

### Thumbs up

In small meeting rounds it is easiest if you explicitly add a short feedback question with each decision: How do you feel about the decision? Thumbs up, thumbs down or ok? We call these polls "Flash Light Polls" and they are most easily comparable as a mix of *Traffic Light Polls* and *Muddiest Point* [^1]. In a second round participants who have shown their thumbs down can briefly explain their disagreement in one sentence and propose a compromise solution. The goal of this exercise is to enable the moderator to quickly measure the confidence of all participants on a topic.

In a remote meeting, such a survey can be technically implemented very quickly:

* In a video conference, each participant holds their thumb or a traffic light card into the camera
* Some video conferencing tools offer features for non-verbal communication. For example Zoom
