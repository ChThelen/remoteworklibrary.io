You know pair programming? Mob programming is similar to pair programming with the whole team.

## What is Mob Programming?

Mob programming is a practise where your complete team comes together to implement a small user story or feature.

## Why do Mob Programming?

Mob Programming helps you to share information about how a problem was solved your source code or how a specific part of the implementation is realized with the whole team. It is also an option to easily onboard new team members or discuss working methods with the help of a concrete example.

## How to do Mob Programming?

Like Pair Programming, Mob Programming also has the roles of driver and navigator. The driver sits at the keyboard, writes the program code and shares the screen for all others (e.g. with video conferencing tool). All other team members watch the shared source code and collaborate on solving the problem. One of the team members has the role of the navigator (this role rotates) and tells the driver what to do.

## Tips

* All team members turn on their video and audio.
* To keep all participants concentrated and active, the rotation frequency must be high (every 2-3 minutes) and the team must not be too large. If there are five or more participants, you are usually already too often inactive.
* The concept of mob programming can also be used to write documentation or tests.
