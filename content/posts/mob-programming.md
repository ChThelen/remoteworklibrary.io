You know pair programming? Mob programming is similar to pair programming with the entire team.

## What is Mob Programming?

Mob programming is a practice where your complete team comes together to implement a small user story or feature.

## Why use it?

Mob Programming helps you to share information about how a problem is solved in your source code or how a specific part of the implementation is realized with the whole team. It is also an option to easily onboard new team members or discuss working methods with the help of a concrete example.

## How to do it?

Like Pair Programming, Mob Programming also has the roles of 'driver' and 'navigator'. The driver writes the program code while sharing the screen for all others (e.g. with video conferencing tool). All participants watch the shared source code and collaborate on solving the problem. One of the team members has the role of the navigator (this role switches) and tells the driver what to do.

## Tips

* All team members turn on their video and audio.
* To ensure all participants stay concentrated and active, the role should switch frequently (every 2-3 minutes) and the team should not be too large. If there are five or more participants, they oftern are inactive.
* The concept of mob programming can also be used to write documentation or tests.
