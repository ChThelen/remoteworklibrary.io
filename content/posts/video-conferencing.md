Video conferencing is a fundamental technology to get in touch in a remote setting. The combination of voice, video, chat, and screen sharing brings teams close together even if there are huge physical distances in between.

## What is it?

Video conferencing is a tool to enable multiple participants (1:1 up to hundreds) to communicate: by voice, by video, by chat, and by screen sharing. 

## Why use it?

Without video conferencing your fallback solution are phone calls and conferences and e-mails. Trust me: you don't want to run into this fallback solution...

## How to do it?

Best practices:
 * always switch on the video. Only switch it off if you've troubles with the internet connection or if you participate in a large meeting where you have no active parts
 * keep the focus on the meeting
 * use virtual backgrounds to avoid visual distractions
 * learn the most important hot keys: start/stop screen sharing, mute/unmute, push-to-talk, mute others (host only)
 * showing support without voice: raise hand, +1 in chat
 * avoid interruptions with questions and async feedback on accompanying chat
 * be dressed (at least above the desk) like in the office
 * get to know the power features of your video conferencing solution like breakout rooms, polls, integrated whiteboards etc
